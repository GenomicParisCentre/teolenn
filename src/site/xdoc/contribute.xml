<!--    <section name="How do I get access to the code repository ?">
      <p>The Teolenn project uses the Subversion system to develop the core parts of the software. Due to security reasons, we cannot open freely this subversion server to external users of the ENS. So if you want contribute to the core of Teolenn, you can send patches to the developer using the developers <a href="mail-lists.html">mailing-list</a>.</p>
